# egel-mods-installer
A Dutch Minecraft Java Edition mod manager for Windows, using mods from the Fabric ecosystem, that makes it easy to install new modpacks, switch between them and uninstall them. It makes this tedious task super quick and easy, with an easy to understand graphical user interface. It even creates launcher profiles for you automatically!
Apart from our modpacks you can also have your own mods as a selectable option, that you installed manually in the mods folder.

All modpacks are composed by us (but we didn't make any of the mods).

# Basic usage
1. Download and run the .exe file.
2. Select a modpack from the dropdown menu.
3. Install it using the **Installeren** button.

Installed modpacks are marked with a black name in the dropdown menu, for non-installed modpacks the name is grayed out.
Freshly installed modpacks are loaded automatically. 

# Manage multiple modpacks
If you have multiple modpacks installed, you can switch between them using the **Mods Laden** button. With this, you can also revert back to your own mods, that you had installed before installing this tool. To do this, choose the **Jouw mods** option in the dropdown menu. 

Only one modpack can be loaded at a time. Loaded modpacks are marked with a **✔** icon in the dropdown menu.

# Deleting modpacks
Select the modpack you want to delete using the dropdown menu. Then, click **Deïnstalleren**. This automatically deletes the mods, as well as the launcher profile. If you delete the version that is currently loaded, it automatically loads your own mods for you.

# Important
- Don't delete any of the folders created in the mods folder, even if they are empty. This tool needs them to function correctly.
- Don't load mods while Minecraft is running.
- If you installed Minecraft in a different folder than the usual %appdata%/.minecraft folder, this tool will not work. (For now)
